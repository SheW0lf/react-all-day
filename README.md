# Hinge Health React Code Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It's a very minimal React application with the following added:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support (via [react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts))
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
- [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/)
- **AsyncTracker**: an in-house solution for tracking Promises within redux; you will use this in one
  of the challenges.

This mostly matches the libraries we use for our production React applications, so it is a good introduction to our
frontend architecture.

To begin the challenge, start with `src/challenge.test.tsx` and follow the instructions in there. The goal is to unskip
the tests, one by one, and get them to pass.
